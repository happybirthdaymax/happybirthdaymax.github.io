Hey babe, my goodness… what do I even say about this? There are so many little things that make you *you*. There are so many small things that make you human, and honestly, I feel like every boyfriend says this about their girlfriend — but with you, it’s actually true. Like how you always get headaches because you don’t drink enough water. You are quite literally the queen of headaches, because you get them all the freaking time. And that’s one of those little things that just makes you human.

I always want to take your headaches away because I know how annoying they are. And for me, my version of that is getting cramps from not drinking enough water too, and I end up screaming like a little girl when it happens — so yeah, it is what it is. But that’s one thing.

And then there’s how much you love exploring. You always love exploring when it comes to open-world games, looking at different places, wandering around. I find it really interesting that in Minecraft, you’re always building. And you’re really good at it. I’m pretty sure you do it because you’re better at building than I am. It feels reversed in Minecraft — like suddenly *you* are the builder and I’m the one who needs to catch up. I definitely need to build more, but I don’t know… it’s just funny.

You love exploring, and you love animals. And honestly, people who don’t like animals are actual walking red flags. Your jokes, your laughs, your little giggles — they make my day every single time. They genuinely make me so happy. And the way you logically approach situations? I think that’s really attractive. I love that about you. The amount of people who *don’t* do that… yeah. You’re different.

And your connection to family — man, you really love your family. I wish I loved mine as much as you love yours, but we all come from different situations and backgrounds. Still, that part of you, that love, that loyalty… that also makes you you.

The way you say “baby,” the way you say you love me — I love that so much. You understand me. You really do. And yeah, we haven’t talked for years, but it feels like we have. I love how you try to understand me, how you try to get where I’m coming from. And I really want to be a better boyfriend for you. I know we’re not official-official, but I still want to be better for you. And I know you’ll probably be like, “Yeah, be better for me,” but still — I genuinely want to, because you push me to be better even when you don’t realize it.

I know you’re like “I don’t give a fuck,” but I genuinely want to be better for you so I can be there for you in a better way. Maybe that’s a me thing, but yeah… that’s there too.

And another thing that makes you you is how you do cute things without acknowledging them. When I point it out, you’re like “huh?” or “shut up,” and when I say cute things to you, you’re like “shut up.” And I don’t know, it just feels like such a *you* thing. That’s just part of who you are, and I love it.

And oh my goodness — your obsession with Skyrim. That is so you. You and Skyrim and open-world games — that’s literally you. I really want to start streaming again so we can play open-world games together, so you can watch me play and we can just vibe.

There are so many more things that make you who you are. I don’t know why they’re not all coming to mind right now, but yeah… everything about you makes you *you*. Nothing can replace you for me. Thank you for being yourself.

And yeah… I love you.
