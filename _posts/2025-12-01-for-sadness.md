Come here, sit with me for a second — let me hug you through these words.

I really hope that by the end of this you’ll feel even a little bit better. I don’t know everything, and you could be feeling sad for so many different reasons, because life just throws things at you out of nowhere. You never really know what to expect or when to expect it. And I know that everyone is sensitive on some level — we just trick ourselves into thinking we’re not.

What always helps me is letting myself actually feel those feelings of sadness. Let yourself feel it. Let yourself sit in it for a moment. Let yourself understand it, go through it, and know that it will pass. It will get smoothed over. You will grow from it. You will learn from it as an experience. I know that sounds like the logical answer to everything, but it really does help, because sometimes your brain gets so confused and overwhelmed that you need something to guide you back to yourself. And I hope that this, in some way or another, helps guide you a little bit.

I’m sending you so many hugs right now and so many kisses. I really hope you feel better soon, and I hope everything in your life smooths out. I know it will — but I hope it happens sooner rather than later. Sometimes you learn from your mistakes, sometimes things happen for a reason, and sometimes things just happen — but no matter what, I’m sending you all the comfort, all the love, and all the hugs that I possibly can.

And I know you might read this again when you’re sad another time, so for the next time, and the next, and the next after that — for forever — I’m giving you infinite hugs, infinite kisses, infinite cuddles, all the food you want, all the drinks you want, all the cravings you have. I'm ready to give all of that to you.

I just want you to know — it will come to pass. It will get better, baby girl.
