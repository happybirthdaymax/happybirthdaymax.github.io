Hey babe, if you’re reading this right now, you’re probably pissed off, annoyed, or just done with everything, so let me just talk to you for a second. First of all, breathe. Seriously. Just breathe for a moment. You don’t have to pretend you’re okay right now. You’re allowed to be mad. You’re allowed to feel things without having to hide it behind that “I don’t care” attitude you love to do. I know you care. I know things get to you. And that’s alright.

Whatever got you angry, whether it was someone being stupid, something not going your way, or life just throwing some random bullshit at you, you don’t have to deal with it alone. I know that when you’re mad, your mind starts racing and everything feels louder and heavier than it is. And I know you’re probably not in the mood to hear some motivational speech or anything like that, so I’m not giving you one. I just want you to know that you can take your time. You can step back. You can cool down at your own pace. It’s not a race to get over it.

And even if you don’t want to talk about it, even if you push me away, even if you’re giving me attitude or ignoring me because everything is annoying you, I’m still right here. I’m giving you a long, warm cuddle in my mind, rubbing your back, holding you close until all that tension melts away. I’m sending forehead kisses, cheek kisses, all the little things I know you like, even if you act like you don’t.

I’m not telling you to just stop being mad. I’m saying it’s okay to be mad, but it won’t stay forever. Your mind will relax eventually. It always does. You’re strong, even when you’re irritated and feel like throwing your phone across the room. And if this is one of those times where you’re reading this again because it’s another annoying day, then just know I’m giving you infinite calm, infinite cuddles, infinite comfort every single time you come back to this. Whatever you need, snacks, drinks, hugs, kisses, I got you.

You’ll be okay, babe. Even if you don’t feel okay right now. I love you.
