Baby… I know this feeling is different. This isn’t sadness, and it isn’t anger — this is that empty, silent feeling where its just static in your brain. Where you’re just kinda floating through your day without really being in it. And I know how draining that can be, even though it looks like “nothing.”

When you’re numb like this, I really don’t expect you to act cheerful or pretend everything’s fine. I am still learning every day, and understanding how I ca nbe there for you. You don’t need to force a smile for me. You don’t need to explain what you don’t understand yourself. I might ask if you want to explan or talk about it but that is up to you <3

You’re not broken for feeling numb. It doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. It doesn’t mean you don’t care. It’s just your mind shutting down for a bit because it’s tired, or overwhelmed, or maybe you’ve been holding too much in for too long. I know that you probably know this but I am just putting this here so that you can remember.  

Let me be the thing you can still feel even when everything else goes blank. Lay on me, lean on me, call me... whatever makes it easier. You don’t have to talk. You don’t have to react. You don’t have to feel anything at all.

I’m not scared of this version of you... I really fucking empathize with you and there is nothing more that I want to do but help. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll stay right here with you, even if we’re just sitting in silence, until things slowly start feeling real again.

I am not here to hurt you, I love you... you’re still you, even in the numbness. And I’m still here for you baby. Always <3
