Baby… I know this one is different. This isn’t sadness, and it isn’t anger — this is that empty, silent feeling where nothing hits. Where you’re just kinda floating through your own day without really being in it. And I know how draining that can be, even though it looks like “nothing.”

When you’re numb like this, I don’t expect you to act cheerful or pretend everything’s fine. You don’t need to force a smile for me. You don’t need to explain what you don’t understand yourself. Just let me sit with you in that quiet space.

You’re not broken for feeling numb. It doesn’t mean something is wrong with you. It doesn’t mean you don’t care. It’s just your mind shutting down for a bit because it’s tired, or overwhelmed, or maybe you’ve been holding too much in for too long.

Let me be the thing you can still feel even when everything else goes blank. Lay on me, lean on me, call me... whatever makes it easier. You don’t have to talk. You don’t have to react. You don’t have to feel anything at all.

I’m not scared of this version of you. I’m not going anywhere. I’ll stay right here with you, even if we’re just sitting in silence, until things slowly start feeling real again.
You’re still you, even in the numbness. And I’m still here, baby. Always <3
