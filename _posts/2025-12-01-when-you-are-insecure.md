I know you’re feeling insecure right now, and before your brain starts running wild(ik it probably already has but bare with me...), I just want to talk to you the same way I’d talk to you if you were right here in my arms.

I wish you could see yourself the way I see you. I really mean that. Because you look at yourself and you notice every little flaw, every tiny thing you think isn’t good enough, and you act like those things define you. And meanwhile I’m sitting here looking at you like, “How does she not see what I see?”

You’re beautiful in a nonchalant way that you don’t even try for. It’s in the way you just go dead silent when I say something stupid. It’s in the way your voice changes when you’re being all sweet without even meaning to. And yeah, I know you’ll probably roll your eyes at this later, but I mean every word.

You’re more than whatever insecurity is picking at your brain right now. You’re more than your body, more than your past, more than whatever you think people might be judging and more than what people say about you. And I don’t want you to shove those feelings down like they don't exist bnecause they do... just give them to me. Let me be the one who reminds you that you're worth so much more than the things you’re afraid of and better and beautifuler <3

I love you, baby. Even the parts you don’t feel confident about. Especially those parts. And I’m always going to think you’re beautiful, even on the days you don’t feel it. MWAH
