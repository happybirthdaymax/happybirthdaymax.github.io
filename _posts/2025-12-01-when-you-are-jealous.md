Baby… I know when jealousy hits, it hits hard. I am a jealous mf as well as you know (FUCK GENERAL SHANG) And I know it’s not because you don’t trust me — it’s just your heart caring a little too much and getting scared of losing something it wants to keep. And I get it. It’s human. It’s normal. And it doesn’t push me away; if anything, it makes me want to hold you tighter.

Listen to me: I choose you. I keep choosing you. Every day. Even when you feel insecure, even when you feel jealous, even when your brain starts making up scenarios out of thin air. None of that changes the fact that you’re the one I want.

I know sometimes you compare yourself to other people. Or you think someone else might catch my attention. But baby, you don’t understand — when I’m with you, I’m locked in. The way you talk, the way you move, the way you think, the way you make me feel… nobody else has that. Nobody else is you.

If something bothers you, tell me. If something makes you uneasy, tell me. I’d rather reassure you a thousand times than have you sit there quietly hurting. You’re not “too much” for needing reassurance. You’re not dramatic. You’re not clingy. You’re just human, and I love you for it.

Come here, jealous girl. Let me remind you who has my heart... SMH
