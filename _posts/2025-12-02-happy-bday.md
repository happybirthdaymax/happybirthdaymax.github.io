Hey babe, I'm very excited and happy for you today, and I know I don’t say this often — and I probably should — but I’m really proud of you. I’m proud of everything you’ve been through, for who you are as a person, for everything you do and say, and for how you’ve handled the things life has thrown at you. I know you’re terrified, because you’re reaching a new stage of life where you’re turning 18 and becoming a legal adult, and there are so many things changing, and so many more things that will change. I’m not saying that to be pessimistic or anything — it’s just how life is. The older you get, the more responsible you have to be, and honestly, it scared me too. But at the end of the day, you’ve got this. You have people who support you, you have people who love you, and I love you a lot. I genuinely care for you.

Sometimes I say things that cause your mood to drop, and I’m really sorry about that. I’m working on my communication skills, and I hope we can grow together in that part of our relationship. You mean a lot to me. You’ve had such a profoundly good impact on my life, and I say that with so much happiness and thankfulness that you came into it. You’ve been really kind, and even with all the nonchalantness you pretend to have, I know deep down that you care. I enjoy all the times we spend together — on Roblox, the horror games, everything.

I know you’re going through exam stress right now, and it’s a rough place to be in. I know what that’s like, because I’m going to start college stuff and certification things soon myself, and honestly, I wouldn’t want to deal with what you’re dealing with at the moment. But I also want you to know that you’ve grown up so much already, and you’ve learned a lot. I’m very confident that you’ll be a really productive adult, and that you’ll absolutely rock whatever you choose to do. We all have our ways to cope, but just know that you have me as your support system — someone who will not leave you.

As annoying as I can be, and as stupid as I sometimes sound, I’m not easy to get rid of. When I love, I love hard, and I choose you. You really make me the happiest guy in the world, and I love you so much. I know I say it a lot, and maybe it feels like it loses meaning because of how often I say it, but every time I say “I love you,” I genuinely feel it — I feel butterflies, I feel happy, I feel everything that love is supposed to be.

Even if we fight or argue, even if I piss you off or you piss me off, I still love you. If I’m the one who’s upset, I might need time to reset my mind, and if it’s you who’s upset, it’s usually because I did something stupid — which is unfortunate — but I’ll definitely try to do better. I’m really thankful for everything, and I hope we have many more years together. You mean the world to me, and I want you to know that I’ll be by your side through anything. And God forbid something ever happens between us relationship-wise, I would still be there for you as a friend, because you deserve the world and you deserve happiness.

And I’m not saying all this just because it’s your birthday. I’ve wanted to write something like this for a long time — I just don’t always like typing things out. But right now felt like the moment to communicate and finally say everything that’s in my heart.

Happy birthday, babe. I love you.
