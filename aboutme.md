Usually pages have an “About Me” section, but this is gonna be an **About YOU**, because today is literally *your* day.

I’m still trying to learn more about you, but here’s what I’ve figured out so far:

- **You’re stupidly kind.** Like… so kind it actually makes me jealous sometimes because um ??? hello ??? shouldn’t that be reserved for ME??? smh. But fr, it’s one of the cutest things about you.

- **You love animals.** And honestly this is such an underrated green flag. Every time I remember this about you it just grows on me more and more. It’s like “oh yeah, THAT’S why I like them so much.”

- **You love k-pop.** Look… what do you want me to say here. Yes. Do I get jealous that you simp over random sexy Korean guys? yEs. Do I still support you loving the culture and the fanbase? Also yes. (I’m working on my issues, okay.)

- **You’re open-minded.** And what I find really nice about it is that yeah, you’ll say what you think, but you also actually listen. We can have the occasional hard talk (when we do), and then we can go right back to talking about whatever like nothing happened. That’s rare and I appreciate it.

- **You’re cute.** And maybe this is just my bias because I like you a lot, but the random little things you do??? adorable. I’m not elaborating further.

- **You’re petty ASF.** This might sound negative but honestly it’s one of the funniest things about you. You get petty and it’s SO obvious and I’m just like… okay then. I still like it tho.

### Best Thing About You

To be honest idek what I’d even pick. And yes, I did in fact add a whole section just to say “I don’t know.” I think it’s more like… all your traits tie together in a way that just works. A whole little bundle of chaos and charm.
