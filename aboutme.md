Usually pages have an "About Me" section, but this is going to be an about **YOU** because this is your special day.

I am still trying to learn more about you, but here are some of the amazing qualities about you that I have come to find out:

- **You are kind** to people, and almost to the point that makes me jealous because... no, that should all be mine... smh.
- **You love animals**... and this is a personally underappreciated green flag that I have come to notice about you that has just been growing on me every time the thought crosses my mind.
- **You love K-pop.** Here is what I will say about this... yes. Do I get jealous that you simp over sexy Korean guys... yEs, but do I support your love for the culture and the fanbase? Also yes. (I am learning to be better.)
- **You are open-minded**, and the thing that I personally find to be beautiful about this trait of yours is that yeah, you will share your opinion about something, but at the same time you listen, and we are able to have talks about difficult topics (whenever we do) and can still continue to talk about other things.
- **You are cute**, and this might just be my own bias due to the fact that I think you are just adorable with the random little things that you do, and with the fact that I like you a lot, but yk... we'll just leave it at that.
- **You are petty ASF.** Now this might come across as a negative trait, but when you are petty about things, you make it so obvious and I'm like yeah... ahem, okay. I do like that you are like that tho.

### **Best Thing About You**

To be honest, idek what I'd pick, and it's like I am shooting myself in the foot right now because I didn't even need to include this part just to say that I don't know. I think that to me it's more of a conglomeration where everything ties together and stuff.
