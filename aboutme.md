Usually pages have an "About Me" section, but this is going to be an about **YOU** because this is your special day.  
And honestly, you kinda deserve a whole page dedicated to you anyway.

I am still trying to learn more about you, but here are some of the amazing qualities about you that I have come to find out (and yes, they keep stacking up, which is insane):

- **You are kind** to people, and almost to the point that makes me jealous because... no, that should all be mine... smh. Like why are you out here being sweet to the world when hello, hi, I’m right here??

- **You love animals**... and this is a personally underappreciated green flag that I’ve noticed about you. It keeps growing on me every time the thought crosses my mind. Like you caring about small creatures??? yeah okay that’s adorable.

- **You love K-pop.** Here is what I will say about this... yes. Do I get jealous that you simp over sexy Korean guys... yEs. Do I support your love for the culture and the fanbase? Also yes. (I am learning to be better, pls clap.)

- **You are open-minded**, and the thing that I personally find beautiful about this trait is that yeah, you’ll share your opinion, but you also actually listen. We can talk about difficult topics (whenever we randomly do), and then go right back to talking about literally anything else like nothing happened. That’s rare, and I like that.

- **You are cute**, and this might just be my bias because I like you a lot, but the random little things you do are just... yeah. Adorable. I’m not saying anything more before I embarrass myself.

- **You are petty ASF.** Now, this might come across as a negative trait, but when you are petty about things, you make it SO obvious and I’m like yeah... ahem, okay. But lowkey? I love that about you too.

### **Best Thing About You**

To be honest, idek what I'd pick, and it's like I am shooting myself in the foot right now because I didn't even need to include this part just to say that I don't know.  
I think for me it's more of a whole *mix* of things — all your traits tying together into this chaotic, sweet, funny, annoyingly adorable combination that just… works.

Like there isn’t one “best” thing.  
It’s literally everything at once, and that’s what gets me.
